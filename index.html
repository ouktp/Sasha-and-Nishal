Itâ€™s best to quit early on in pregnancy, but quitting at any time gives your baby a better chance of a healthy start in life.</p>
  <p class = "paragraph1">It's not just mothers-to-be, but their partners who should quit smoking. <strong>Passive smoking </strong>can also harm mother and baby, so a smoke-free household means a healthier family. It can be challenging, but with some support you can reach your goals.</p>  
  <h2 class = "header2" id="effects">How smoking affects your baby</h2>
  <p class = "paragraph2">Smoking during pregnancy exposes your baby to harmful chemicals. Every time you smoke, the baby effectively smokes too, as harmful nicotine and other chemicals pass through the placenta and into the fetus. Smoking also reduces blood flow for your baby.</p>
